## What I Built
<!-- Share an overview about your project. -->
Optimizing Business Efficiency with AI Operators
Many businesses spend hours daily taking orders over the phone from prospective clients, leading to less productive employee time and increased operational costs.

AI Operators can revolutionize this process by intuitively collecting orders from prospective clients and notifying the business through email or external APIs when an order is ready for fulfillment. This automation will enhance employee productivity and reduce business costs by streamlining the manual order collection process.

A compelling proof of concept for such AI Operators is the AI Taxi Dispatch Operator. This solution enables taxi companies to automate the booking process and dispatch drivers and vehicles using the company's dispatch system via APIs or manual assignments.

In this implementation, Twilio WhatsApp messaging is utilized to create an AI operator built with OpenAI technology. The AI operator gathers all necessary information from the user, sends out dispatch requests through the company's dispatch API, and notifies both the company and the user when a driver has been dispatched.

By integrating AI Operators, businesses can significantly improve efficiency, reduce costs, and provide better service to their clients.
